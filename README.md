This is a senior design project at Iowa State University for a fleet management system. It involves using a set of Raspberry Pi's with PiCAN2's attached to upload data to a Node.js server which provides an API to a website for fleet managers to view statistics and live tracking data for their fleet. The project will be in development through April of 2018.

Disclaimer: This project is not yet sufficiently tested for use. We do not recommend that anyone relies on it currently.
